          # If you're using a format for the PR title that differs from the traditional Conventional
          # Commits spec, you can use these options to customize the parsing of the type, scope and
          # subject. The `headerPattern` should contain a regex where the capturing groups in parentheses
          # correspond to the parts listed in `headerPatternCorrespondence`.
